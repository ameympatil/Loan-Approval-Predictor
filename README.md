# Loan Approval Predictor

## Overview
The Loan Approval Predictor is an individual project developed as part of the Kaggle Loan Approval Prediction competition. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant features. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions.

## Project Description
In this project, we aim to predict loan approval status using a dataset that includes various features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and more. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following features:
- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- **Gender**: Gender of the applicant.
- **Married**: Marital status of the applicant.
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents.
- **Education**: Education level of the applicant.
- **Self_Employed**: Employment status.
- **ApplicantIncome**: Income of the applicant.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Income of the co-applicant.
- **LoanAmount**: Amount of loan requested.
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Duration of the loan in months.
- **Credit_History**: Credit history of the applicant (1 = good, 0 = bad).
- **Property_Area**: Area of the property.
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable (Y = approved, N = not approved).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Loan-Approval-Predictor.git
   cd Loan-Approval-Predictor
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis and model training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Loan_Approval_Predictor.ipynb
   ```

## Modeling
The project employs various machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
